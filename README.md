# CrabGameMapGlitchFixer
Stops players from going out of bounds or using glitch spots in Crab Game.  

**Note**: This mod is based on code from [JMac's Mods](https://github.com/JMac8132). I copied the relevant parts and turned it into a standalone mod focused on fixing glitches and boundaries.

### What it does  
- **Kills players outside map boundaries**  
  - Works on all maps (Bitter Beach, Snowtop, Color Climb, etc).  
  - Each map has its own distance limit from center.  

- **Fixes glitch spots**  
  - Color Climb
  - Snowtop
  - (S) Beach
  - Bitter Beach

### How it works  
- Host only (you must be lobby host).  
- Automatically checks players every frame.
